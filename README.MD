1. Commit - Creates a new change that compares the previous version of a file to the updated version of the file.  
To do a commit, you need to add the files that have been edited for the task.  Only add the files that have been edited for the task / commit.

2. Clone - A clone copies a repository

3. Fork - A fork is a copy of a repository that maintains a link with the origin repository so changes can be sent back 
to the original repository, even if it is on a different account.  This allows people to work on their own repositories 
and selectively submit changes back to the original.
